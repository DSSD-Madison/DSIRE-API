            Hello from the folks at DSIRE! You're approved for API access. Your
            key is:
        </p>
        <code>${accessToken}</code>
        <p>
		<p>
            Keep your key secret! Should you need to revoke it, click
            <a href="${revocationLink}">here</a> at any time. We recommend
            archiving this email, just in case.
        <p>
